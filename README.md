### Project Name: Plastic Pollution Tracker

#### Problem Statement:
Plastic pollution is a significant environmental issue affecting oceans, rivers, and terrestrial ecosystems. Illegal dumping and improper disposal contribute to the accumulation of plastic waste, posing threats to wildlife and ecosystems. This project aims to address this problem by empowering communities to report and track instances of plastic pollution.

#### Features:

1. **User Reporting Interface:**
   - Allow users to report instances of plastic pollution through a user-friendly web interface or mobile app.
   - Include features for geotagging the location of the pollution incident.

2. **GIS Mapping:**
   - Utilize GIS capabilities to map reported instances of plastic pollution.
   - Categorize and visualize the data based on the type of plastic, severity, and frequency of incidents.

3. **Real-time Reporting:**
   - Implement a real-time reporting system that instantly updates the map with new incidents as users submit reports.
   - Enable users to attach photos and descriptions to provide more context.

4. **Data Validation and Moderation:**
   - Implement a system to validate and moderate reported incidents to ensure accuracy and reliability.
   - Include a reporting mechanism for false or misleading information.

5. **Heatmap Visualization:**
   - Create heatmaps to highlight areas with a high concentration of reported plastic pollution incidents.
   - Use this information to identify hotspots for targeted cleanup and awareness campaigns.

6. **Collaboration with Environmental Organizations:**
   - Partner with environmental organizations, NGOs, or local government agencies to leverage their expertise and resources.
   - Collaborate on cleanup initiatives and educational campaigns based on the mapped data.

7. **Educational Content:**
   - Provide educational resources on the environmental impact of plastic pollution.
   - Raise awareness about sustainable practices and alternatives to single-use plastics.

8. **Community Engagement:**
   - Foster community engagement by allowing users to track the impact of cleanup efforts and share success stories.
   - Implement a leaderboard or recognition system for active participants.

9. **Analytics and Trends:**
   - Analyze trends in plastic pollution data over time.
   - Generate reports and insights to identify patterns, such as common types of plastics or recurring dumping locations.

10. **Government and Policy Advocacy:**
    - Share aggregated data and insights with local authorities to support evidence-based decision-making.
    - Advocate for policy changes to address plastic pollution and enforce stricter regulations.

11. **Integration with Social Media:**
    - Allow users to share their cleanup activities and plastic pollution reports on social media platforms.
    - Increase project visibility and encourage community involvement.

### Technologies:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, React js and Typescript.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Revelo.
- **Database:** MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user reports and GIS data.
- **GIS Library/API:** Mapbox, Leaflet.js, or Google Maps API.
- **User Authentication:** Implement user accounts to enhance data integrity and user engagement.
- **Real-time Capabilities:** WebSocket or a real-time database to update the map in real-time.

### Project Impact:
The Plastic Pollution Tracker project has the potential to make a tangible impact by mobilizing communities to actively participate in addressing plastic pollution. It provides a comprehensive platform for reporting, mapping, and responding to plastic pollution incidents while fostering awareness, collaboration, and advocacy for sustainable practices.

By visualizing the data on a map, this project can empower local communities, environmental organizations, and policymakers to take targeted actions to mitigate the effects of plastic pollution and work towards a cleaner and healthier environment.
